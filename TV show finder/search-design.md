The search engine operates by first indexing TV show data and then offering users the ability to search for TV shows based on their descriptions.

### How It Works:

###### index.py: 
This script establishes a connection to an SQLite database that holds TV show information. It processes the show descriptions by performing tasks such as tokenization and lemmatization. It then computes TF-IDF vectors for each description. These vectors, along with preprocessed data, are saved to an output file named indexed_tv_data.pkl.

###### search.py: 
This script accesses the indexed data generated by index.py. It receives a search query and pre-processes it in a manner akin to the indexed descriptions. The query is subsequently transformed into a TF-IDF vector. The script calculates cosine similarity scores between the query vector and the indexed TV show data. The shows with the highest similarity scores are presented as search results.
Design Rationale:

The design adheres to fundamental information retrieval and text processing principles. TF-IDF vectors and cosine similarity are widely accepted techniques for identifying relevant documents or TV shows based on text data.

The modular design offers flexibility. Data can be indexed once and queried multiple times with various search queries.
The code is organized and leverages external libraries, such as NLTK and scikit-learn, to efficiently handle various NLP and machine learning tasks. It's well-suited for small datasets and provides a foundation for more sophisticated search engines.

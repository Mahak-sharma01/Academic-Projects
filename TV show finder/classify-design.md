The classifier is designed to predict the genre of a TV show based on its description. It utilizes a machine learning model that has been trained on a dataset of TV show descriptions and their corresponding genres. Here's how the classifier works:

##### Data Collection: 
The training data is collected from a SQLite database(tvmaze.sqlite) containing information about TV shows and their associated genres. This data is loaded and preprocessed to create a clean and structured dataset.

##### Data Preprocessing: The 
TV show descriptions are preprocessed to remove redundant words, such as URLs, stopwords, and irrelevant characters. Tokenization and lemmetization is applied to the descriptions to standardize the format and reduce the dimensionality of the data.

##### Model Training:
The preprocessed descriptions are vectorized and used to train a machine learning model. In this specific implementation, a deep learning model is employed, including layers for text vectorization, embedding, and classification. The model is trained to predict the genres of TV shows based on their descriptions.

##### Genre Prediction: 
The model predicts the genres that best describe the show, when we give a description to it. It calculates the probability of each genre, and the genres with probabilities above a certain threshold(0.5) are considered the predicted genres. In this we predicted top 3 genres as our output.

##### Explanations with LIME:
The classifier utilizes the LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) framework to provide explanations for its predictions which is reallyy= useful for transparency and interpretability. These explanations help someone to understand why a particular genre was predicted based on the show's description.

##### Why This Design?
I used this classifier design for several reasons given below:

##### Text-Based Classification: 
TV show descriptions are inherently text data, making text classification techniques a natural choice. Deep learning models, such as the one used here, are well-suited for capturing complex relationships in text data and are capable of achieving high classification accuracy.

##### Multilabel Classification: 
The design supports multilabel classification, meaning a TV show can belong to multiple genres simultaneously. This is common in real-world scenarios, where shows can cross genres.

##### Transparency and Interpretability: 
The addition of LIME explanations enhances the classifier's transparency and interpretability. Users can understand why a specific genre was predicted, helping them trust and make sense of the model's predictions.

##### Efficiency: 
The use of pretrained word embeddings and early stopping in model training helps prevent overfitting and improve efficiency. The accuracy of the model came 54%.

In conclusion, this design offers an effective and interpretable solution for predicting TV show genres based on descriptions, making it valuable for recommendation systems, content tagging, and other applications where understanding the genre of a TV show is crucial.
